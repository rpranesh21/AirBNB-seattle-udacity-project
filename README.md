# AirBNB-seattle-udacity-project

### Installations:
The project has been done in the Anaconda enviroment with python 3.6 No packages outside anaconda is nescessary. The following packages were used:
- numpy
- pandas
- matplotlib
- sklearn
- calendar
- sklearn.model_selection (train_test_split module)
- sklearn.preprocessing (Imputer and StandardScaler modules)
- sklearn.linear_model (LinearRegression module)
- sklearn.tree (Adaboost module)
- sklearn.tree (preprocessing)
- sklearn.tree (Random Forest module)
- sklearn.tree (SVM)

### Motivation:
The project was part of [Udacity](https://www.udacity.com/) Data Science Nanodegree. This was one of the submission in Nano degree. The project asked the course takers to select a dataset and answer 3-5 business questions.

The questions aswered were:
1. How does price of AirBNB property changes with neighbourhood in Seattle?
2. Does price has any seasonality effect, around the year?
3. How much price fluctuation is observed between weekends and weekdays?
4. What would be the best Machine Learning technique to predict price?

### Dataset
Source - Kaggle
[Seattle Airbnb Open Data](https://www.kaggle.com/airbnb/seattle/data)

### Key Findings:
1. Prices for AirBNB are motivated by neighbourhood in Seattle, with pockets of high and low prices
2. Summers in Seattle is the best time to travel, and May to July observed highest peaks and highest pricing
3. Around 15% jump is obseved, when prices of weekends are compared with prices of weekdays
34. Out of 3 ML techniques, Random Forest is the most accurate model in rpedicting prices (compared to Adaboost and SVM)
